Anna Leach on Bias - If something happened on previous year, prior report, prior week - I already analyzed it before so I'm moving out -- Mistake. Feeling of being irreplacable at work as an analyst. Show if she could do analysis fast, able to communicate it with stakeholders.She could be irreplacable -- making her hesitant to talk with other teammates and ask questions and solely work on solo researching.
Mistakes during analysis.
Instead of diving deep - Take 30K foot view of the project, bother people. Look at data, ask questions, look for patterns on data and then work on cleaning & processing data.

Data analyst - Take information from blackbox - tell story based on question asked or your perspective / analysis result from data.
Her encounter to know in a conference about - Rift between educational practice and research.
