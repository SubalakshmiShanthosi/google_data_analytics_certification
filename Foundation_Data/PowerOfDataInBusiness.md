# Power of data in business

Often confusion in theme for data analysis - existing issues to explore / questions to ask / problem to solve.
Issue - topic or subject to investigate
Question - Designed to discover information
Problem - An obstacle or complication that need to be addressed.

Business task - A problem or question data analysis answers for business.

Data driven decision making - using facts to guide business strategy.
Observation / gut feeling or intution - can only take you look at part of the picture. Not take us far to get complete solution to fix the problem. Whereas, With data complete picture of the problem and it's causes are uncovered which can be used to create solution to the problem.

Why Fairness in Data analysis process-
    Fairness - Ensuring that the data analysis doesn't create or re-inforce bias.

    Example of how data analysis let to a biased decision - Hiring decision based on the performance of existing workforce where there isn't balance of data - will all groups of diverse people and skewed with more men who perform well
    But the gap here is the difficulties of different gender people navigating through workforce/ are we capturing the differences and diversity to make decision on whom to hire? 
    
        Ensure fairness from the moment data collection is started. 
    
    Example - Stroke belt - mobile app to track patients at risk of cardiovasular disease. 
    - Fairness was the priority while building this application
    - Teamed analysts with social scientist - who provides human bias insights, social context that created bias
    - Self reported data is created by each person - avoid potential racial bias
    - Oversampling non-dominant groups to ensure equal representation of all types in population/data

## Self-reflection Case Study

Case Study 1:
To improve the effectiveness of its teaching staff, the administration of a high school offered the opportunity for all teachers to participate in a workshop. They were not required to attend; instead, the administration encouraged teachers to sign up. Of the 43 teachers on staff, 19 chose to take the workshop.

At the end of the academic year, the administration collected data on teacher performance for all teachers on staff. The data was collected via student survey. In the survey, students were asked to rank each teacher's effectiveness on a scale of 1 (very poor) to 6 (very good).

The administration compared data on teachers who attended the workshop to data on teachers who did not. The comparison revealed that teachers who attended the workshop had an average score of 4.95, while teachers who did not attend had an average score of 4.22. The administration concluded that the workshop was a success.

Reflection

    Consider this scenario: 
    What are the examples of fair or unfair practices?
    How could a data analyst correct the unfair practices?
    Now, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of these questions. Enter your response in the text box below. 

    Response: 
    Unfair practice here is to determine effectiveness of teacher based on only the student ranks. This doesn't take into account of the effort, teaching plan, assignments, and other efforts done by teacher and their drive to complete the process from start to finish. 
    Data analyst can instead ask the teachers to self-reflect on how the workshop improved their daily work functions.  
    To correct the unfair practices - team up with people, talk through your steps and ask for ways to improve them.

Case Study 2:

An automotive company tests the driving capabilities of its self-driving car prototype. They carry out the tests on various types of roadways—specifically, a race track, trail track, and dirt road.
The researchers only test the prototype during the daytime. They collect two types of data: sensor data from the car during the drives and video data of the drives from cameras on the car.

They review the data after the initial tests. The results illustrate that the new self-driving car meets the performance standards across each of the roadways. As a result, the car can progress to the next phase of testing, which will include driving in various weather conditions.

    Response: 
    Unfair practice - Not considering the self-driving car tests on nighttime and other climatic conditions. 
    Not considering other real-life scenario of how it behaves on traffic, crowd or places where the hinderance for the driver would be more.

Case Study 3:

An amusement park plans to add new rides to their property. First, they need to determine what kinds of new rides visitors want the park to build. In order to understand their visitors’ interests, the park develops a survey.
They decide to distribute the survey near the roller coasters because the lines are long enough that visitors will have time to answer all of the questions. After collecting this survey data, they find that most of the respondents want more roller coasters at the park. They conclude that they should add more roller coasters, as most of their visitors prefer them.

    Response:
    During data collection- It was only near one ride and that would create bias for the audience waiting in line for roller coaster to respond that they like it more. 
    But, the collection should happen at the entrance, at all places evenly distributed throughout all possible directions. 
    Collect the survey from other audience apart from the audience on amusement park. Ensure even distribution of data across social and economic representation of population.
