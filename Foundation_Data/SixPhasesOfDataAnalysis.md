# Six Phases of Data Analysis

Ask- Understand the problem to be solved or ask questions to be answered.

Prepare - Find and collect data - Identify data sources, gather data, and verify that it is accurate and useful for answering your questions.

Process - clean and organize your data - Removing inconsistencies, filling values, changing data types for easier analysis.

Analyze - Tasks such as counting averages, counting items in a category or identify patterns and trends.

Share - Present your findings to decision-makers through report/presentation/dashboards

Act- Implementing new business strategy, making changes to website, or any action that solves the problem found on step 1.

Iteration during the data analysis process - Data analysis process builds on itself meaning each step are the inputs for the next step.

## Dimensions of data analytics

Decision Intelligence - Applied data science and Social and managerial sciences.
Data science - Umbrella term for data analytics, statistics and machine learning
What you lean to?
    If you want to make important decision on uncertainity - Statistics
    If you want to automate, meaning make many many unknown decisions - Machine Learning and AI
    But, if you don't know how many decisions you can make before you begin - Data analysts

    Statisticians - protect the decision maker to not get into wrong decision making. if that care on conformance to heuristics and rigor interests you.

    Machine Learning AI - Take up challenges to build performant and build automation system that performs this task with 99.99999 percent

    Analyst - The excellence of an analyst is speed. How quickly can you surf through vast amounts of data to explore it and discover the gems, the beautiful potential insights that are worth knowing about and bringing to your decision-makers?

        "Here is a whole lot of data. No one has looked at it before. Go find something interesting"

## Analytical Thinking

Analytical thinking breakdown
    1. Curiosity => Eagerness to learn and want to learn about data analysis, evolving and improving skills to turn data to insights in fast possible way.
    2. Understanding context => Understanding context helps you solve problems by narrowing down variables that are most likely to influence the outcome, which in turn enables you to come up with more meaningful insights.
    3. Technical Mindset => Remember that problems aren't always technical, but a technical mindset is the skill that you use to break down any complex issue into manageable parts. Focusing on implementing a process, regardless of what that looks like, is a great first step to exercising your technical mindset.
    4. Data design => how you choose to structure your data makes analysis easier and more insightful.
    5. Data strategy => Think about a data strategy as a kind of resource allocationâ€”the tools, time, and effort that you put into a project will vary based on what you need to accomplish.
