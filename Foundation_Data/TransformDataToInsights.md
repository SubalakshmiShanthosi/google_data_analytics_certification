## New Data Perspectives

Story of six steps taken by people analytics - Collect data about Employees and work life experiences.
Objective: How can the organization improve the retention rate for new employees?

    Step 1: Ask - Ask effective questions collaborate with leaders and managers 
        Ex: What should new employee learn to be successful in their first year of the job?
            Do you have data gathered from new employees before? do you have them accessible (historical data)
            What could be the reason of dissatisfaction of new employee?
            Do manager with high retention rate offer employees something unique?
            By what % the retention rate should increase next year? (Goal)
    
    Step 2: Prepare - Decide what data to be used - collect data -- surveys from employees

        Ex Preparation Steps: Specific questions to be asked on hiring and onboarding and overall compensation
        Protect the data to avoid unauthorized access - Anyone outside this group should **not** have access to raw data - but can view aggregated or summarized data. 
        What specific data need to be collected and visualization strategies.
        Analyze data specific and project specific issues and mitigate them. 
    
    Step 3: Process - Collecting and **using data ethically** is one of the responsibilities of data analysts.
        Data cleaning and preparation process - 
            Restrict data access to few data analysts
            Clean the data - ensure data **completeness, correctness and relevance**. Certain data aggregated and summarized without revealing individual responses. 
            They uploaded raw data to an internal data warehouse for an additional layer of security. 

    Step 4: Analyze - After **analyzing data patterns, relationship and answering heuristics** - 
        People analyst discovered that their employees experience on certain processes was key indicator of overall job satisfaction.
        
        The group knew it was important to **document** exactly what they found in the analysis, no matter what the results. 

    Step 5: Share - Share the report. To appropriate audience (managers)
        Ex: Sharing report to managers who met or exceeded minimum number of direct reports
            To know full picture and enable their communication to teammates from them to the teammates. 

    Step 6: Act - implement changes and take actions 

        Ex: Conduct surveys periodically and compare results with previous year. 
            Ensure transperency and efficient processes during hiring and onboarding.
