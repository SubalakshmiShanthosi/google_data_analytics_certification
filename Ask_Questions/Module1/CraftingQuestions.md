# Craft Effective Questions

Types of questions-
    Leading Question - I like this X and it's the best, aren't they?' - Unless there is disagreement or conflict your answer would be leading to the answer in a certain way.
    Closed Ended - Did you enjoy this today? - The reply is yes/no - But you haven't got a chance to dig deep into it. Rarely lead to valuable insights.
    Vague questions that lacks context.

SMART Methodology
Specific - Simple questions, significant and focused on single topic with few closely related details.
Measureable - Measurable questions are quantified and assessed.
Action oriented questions - Encourages change.
Relevant Questions- Significant questions that help us solve the problem.
Time bound questions - specify the time to be studied.

Fairness while crafting questions => Ensuring that the questions doesn't create or re-inforce bias.
    Example - Lead oriented question - I like this X and it's the best, aren't they? - wouldn't lead to honest answer
    Questions should have clear and straight-forward wordings.

Questions with SMART methodology -

    Open-ended questions - The responses would be quantifyable - 
    agree/disagree - 
    Example- Scale of 1 to 10 , top N features you like, What feature if included you like, How does a component X contribute to it's value, in your opinion

    Types of questions to avoid - 
        Example unfair question - This product is too expensive isn't it? (leading question)
            Instead - What price range would make you consider purchasing this product?
        Example -  Were you satisfied with the customer trial? (closed-ended questions)
            Instead- What did you learn about customer experience from the trial?
        Example - Does the tool work for you? (vague, lack of context)
            Instead - When it comes to data entry, is the new tool faster, slower, or about the same as the old tool? If faster, how much time is saved? If slower, how much time is lost?

Self reflection:
    Based on SMART framework - Open-ended quantifyable questions are most important to ask? Questions should be Specific to the topic on focus, Measurable - questions responses should be quantifyable and assesed, Action oriented - Encourages change to desirable state by solving problem, Relevant - Significant questions that help us solve the problem, Time bound - Specify the time to be studied.
    These questions clarify the requirements in ASK phase of data analytics process and asking correct and un-biased questions take the analysis process in a proper direction with proper utilization of resources and better context.
    Asking vague or unclear question will harm the data analysis process- May induce bias and not lead to fair analysis process. Might include delay by leading to re-iteration to capture additional context and clarity after moving to later stages of data analysis process.
