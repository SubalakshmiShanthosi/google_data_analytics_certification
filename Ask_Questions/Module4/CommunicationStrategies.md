# Communication strategies

Tips for effective communication:
    Know your audience!
    What they already know?
    Whay they need to know?
    How can you best communicate what they need to know?

Problem reframing: Restating a problem or challenge, then redirecting it toward a potential resolution

Communication with stakeholder:
    Data analyst would see if the data they have gives a story.
    What if there is a theory given by data analyst and the supporting findings actually make meaningful impact on real-world case.
    Example given for this scenario - Problem of increasing employee engagement in organization and reduce the number of exits.
    From data, analyst found a theory that the employee engagement drop at 13th month after joining and huge hiring 18 months before current date. From both the data, suggestion to the management to setup 1:1 and also survey's to find gaps of their interests and their expectations.

Data trade-off - speed vs accuracy
    Why? understanding context of any failure or problem taken to consideration.
    Example - Hiring scenario - Issue spotted and asked for analyst for report on why the onboarding courses are partial complete by new joiners
    Data analyst - specifically ask questions to know about the problem, seeks a specified timeline than giving instant numbers - Analyze the course completion information from portal
    also create anonymous surveys to better understand the limitations and challenges from new hires while on track for completion of the courses.
    With both the data - context or root cause of outdatedness felt by the new hires on these courses are conveyed along with supporting data to next step of taking action on the problem.

Limitations of data
    The case of incomplete(or non existance) data
     To be caught while data analysis phase and you should communicate and ask for more data and also say you see this as an limit while analysis and use the data available at moment.
     Find for alternative data source when you find limitation on data.
    Don't miss data misalignment
     Cross functional teams - different teams capture different level of data
     Ex: One team means total number of trainees count as number of new hires who have completed the the courses after enrolling or other
     team capture no of trainees enrolled for the course.
     Establish how the data is collected across team.
    Deal with data cleaning
     data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset.
    Tell a clear story
     Compare same type of data - While visualization of data with different types of charts - make sure to check on same types of data is taken throughout the report - look for segments that show different metric.
     Visualize with care - Showing 0.01% drop on a huge scale needs zoom in or doesn't show significance - instead set Y axis to 0.
    Leave out needless graphs
      If tabular data conveys the story - no need to include graphical representation - pie or bar
    Test for statistical significance
    Pay attention to sample size: To little / correct sample size / look for gathering huge data to check for charts trends over long duration.

    Be the judge:
    Take necessary steps to make sure that the data is clean and consistant.
