Data presentation - Reports and Dashboards

__Report__ - static collection of data given to stakeholders at regular intervals of time. - Snapshots of High level historic data.

__Dashboard__ - monitor dynamic live data ingestions.
Dashboards - dynamic, play through filters, Low maintenance, More Stakeholder access

But, downside - when basetable for dashboard breaks - need more additional work to fix and get back the dashboard live.
More effort for building dashboards than reports. Can include more information with more side-side panel revealing more insights on different levels of data and grouping. For people new to looking at dashboard might feel lost while interpreting the results.

Reports - Spreadsheet - Pivot tables - example shown - aggregation of sales by salesperson - row - salesperson, column - sales amount

Metric - Single quantifiable data that can be used for measurement. Metrics can be combined with formulas
Example - Customer retention data, business - Return on Investments

Goal to reach certain customer sales value, percentage of repeat customers
