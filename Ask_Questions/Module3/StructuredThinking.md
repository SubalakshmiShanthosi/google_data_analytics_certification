# Structured Thinking

Problem domain - Specific area of analysis that encompasses every activity affecting or affected by the problem.
Structured thinking
    Process of thinking current problem or situation
    Organizing available information
    Revealing gaps or opportunities
    Identifying the options
Allows to understand the problem at high level - so that we can find out areas which need deeper understanding.
Starting place of structured thinking is the problem domain.
Avoid rework by - Scope of Work (SoW) - Agreed upon outline of the work you are performing on a project.
Work details, schedule and reports.
SOW for data analyst - Deliverables, Timeline, Milestones, Reports.

SOW Self reflection

Question:
    How did you identify and formalize the projects requirements?
    What questions did you ask in order to define the foundational boundaries and pieces of your analytical content,
    which may include descriptions of your deliverables, timelines, milestones, and reports?

Response:
    Identifying project requirement is to find the problem domain by finding out the problem in the system / process to be improved.
    After finding the problem domain - structured thinking on building Scope-of-Work is neccessary to formulate step-by-step
    approach of Setting timeline of the data analytics process, what milestones are along the timeline,
    How are the reports to be given and planned for rollout to customers.

Data becomes more valuable when it's diagnostic (why did it happen?) and predictive (what will happen?) than descriptive (what happened?)
Even more valuable when it's prescriptive (how can we make it happen?)

Data collection => Who, What, When, Where, How and Why?

Who: The person or organization that created, collected, and/or funded the data collection

What: The things in the world that data could have an impact on

Where: The origin of the data

When: The time when the data was created or collected

Why: The motivation behind the creation or collection

How: The method used to create or collect it

Why can have particularly strong relationship with bias.
To avoid bias - collect accurate representation of the population, and collect the data in the most appropriate, and objective way.

Self Reflection:
    Question:
    Why is it important to create SMART questions about your datasets? How do these questions benefit your work as a data professional?
    Why is it important to determine your SMART questions and answers before crafting an SOW?
    Why is it important to perform data analysis on datasets?

    Response:
    SMART questions on dataset would examine the questions we need to ask to find out the objective of analysis. 
    What appropriate features are their for analysis, quantitative and qualitative data on dataset.
    It is important to determine SMART questions to better understand the problem domain and enable structured thinking while crafting an SOW.
    Data analysis on datasets enables the stakeholders to understand the real-sense of why the happening is and look for transforming data into more diagnostic, predictive or prescriptive to gain valuable insights.
