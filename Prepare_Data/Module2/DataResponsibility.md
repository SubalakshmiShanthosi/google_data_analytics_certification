Ex: Rounding up blood pressure reading by health care professional considering the sensitivity of BP machine - Might lead to miss of a medical condition - Studies on this data cannot be precise and accurate.
3. Interpretation bias - Tendency to always interpret ambiguous situation in a positive or negative way.
