# Work with Databases

Relational Database - contains tables - Top level - table names -- drill deeper - look into attributes of the table
Field exists on two or more table - can be used for joining the table.
Primary key and secondary key(Foreign key) -> a foreign key is a field within a table that is a primary key in another table.
Normalization - process of creating data tables and establish relationships between those tables. it is applied to remove data redundancy in tables, ensure data integrity, and reduce complexcity in database.

Composite key - Some tables don't have primary key but can have multiple foreign keys.
