    Physical - Depicts how database operates - database table names,columns, data types for the database

Data Modelling - ERD diagrams and UML diagram - For a object oriented programming implementation of data modelling UML is preferred.

    Wide data - Every data subject has a single row with multiple columns to hold the value of various attr of the subject.
    Long data - Data in which each row is one time point per subject, so each subject will have data in multiple rows
    Conversion between one form to another.
